      <h3>Debates</h3>
      <p>Although Gov. Rick Perry debated his two opponents in the Republican primary earlier that year, he never agreed to a debate against his leading general election opponent, Democrat Bill White, former mayor of Houston. Perry said that he would not debate White until White released 15-year-old tax records from when he served as deputy U.S. Secretary of Energy. White refused Perry's ultimatum and eventually appeared in a <a href="http://www.klru.org/civicsummit/governorsdebate2010.php">televised debate</a> against two minor party opponents, Libertarian Kathie Glass, and Deb Shafto of the Green Party.</p>

      <div class="explainer-text">“Texans are tired of waiting for Bill White to release his taxes, as am I,” said Perry. “I am eager to participate in a debate, as I have during previous statewide campaigns, but if Bill White refuses to be honest with the people of Texas about how he profited while serving the public, I will not share a debate stage with him."</div>

      <p><strong>The challenger used the debates to beat the incumbent.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923039,00.html">TIME</a> said on Nov. 1, 1982:</p>
      <div class="explainer-text">White, the underfunded underdog, began to edge up after three televised debates gave him an opportunity to put Clements on the defensive.</div>
      <p><em>The Dallas Morning News</em> said on Oct. 12, 1982 of the Oct. 11 debate:</p>
      <div class="explainer-text">
        <p>It was the first time a gubernatorial debate had been broadcast live throughout the state.</p>
      <p>…Visually, the Clements-White face-off was suitable for black-and-white television sets.  Both candidates wore dark suits and white shirts. Their backdrop as a cross between black and navy blue.  The camera captured only one angle, and that was straight on.  There were no reaction shots of the candidates, as there were during the 1980 presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.  In short, this was a no-frills production.  As such, it couldn’t be called ‘good television,’ but it could be termed a wholly responsible, if colorless way to stage an issue-oriented debate.</p>

        <p><strong>Bill Clements</strong> touted the state’s “great business climate.” He said that Texas was “the best place in America to live and work and raise a family.”</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p><strong>Mark White</strong>: “That kind of bragging may enhance Bill Clements’ reputation, but it also causes unemployed people from the North to move to Texas looking for work.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>After Clements and White argued over the specifics of Houston’s long-range transportation plan, Clements called White’s statistics “wampy-jawed.”</p>
